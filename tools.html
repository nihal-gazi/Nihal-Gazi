<h2>FAQs</h2>
<p>Q1. Are you an idiot?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Q3. What the hail is this?</p>

<p>Ans- This is an AI Text Generator that can be used to generate stories. It is 100% Free and has little to no NSFW filter.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Q4. Why is there an image?</p>

<p>Ans- The images are generated by the AI. It takes the output as a response and generates an image based on the generated text. The images may not be coherent due to limitations like, size of prompts and those of Diffusion-based algorithms in general.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Q5. Can I own the images?</p>

<p>Ans- Yes.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Q6. Is this ChatGPT or BARD ?</p>

<p>Ans- It&#39;s neither ChatGPT nor BARD. It is a different AI called PaLM- by Google. This AI is new and is at its very early stages. This project is just a demonstration of what this AI is capable of.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Q7. Which AI used for the images?</p>

<p>Ans- I am using Stable Diffusion for generating images.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Q8. Is the AI free?</p>

<p>Ans- The entire service is Free and has little to no NSFW filters. Courtesy to Google and Pollination.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Q9. Why can&#39;t the AI generate any more output?</p>

<p>Ans- This is a problem from Google&#39;s server. It sometimes mistakenly considers some prompts as invalid. This problem will soon be fixed in future versions of PaLM.&nbsp;</p>
